It felt as if there was some kind of wall between us.

This cought my attention because ealier we'd noticed a pattern among the most successful startups,
and it seemde to hing on a different quality.

We found the startups that were the ones with the sort of founders about whom w'd say 'they can take care of themselves'

The startups that do best are fire-and-forget in the sense taht all you have to do si give them a lead, and 
they'll close it, whatever type of lead it is.

Because the phrase is not only overused, but overused in an indirect way, and most people don't know what it means.

What it means is that if someone is wise, all you have to do is say one word to them, and they'll understand immediately.

You don't have to explain in detail, and they'll chase down all the implications.

understanding the implications even the inconvenient implications of what someone tells you is a subset if resourcefulness.

Chasing down the implications of what is said to you can sometimes lead to unconftable conclusions.

Intellectually they were as capable as the founders of following the implications of what one said to them .

So being hard to talk to was not what was killing the unsuccessful startups.

It was a sign of a underlying lack of resourcefulness.

As well as faling to chase down the implications of what was said to them, the unsuccessful founders would also

fail to chase down funding, and users, and sources of new ideas.

But the most immediate evidence I had that something was amiss was that I couldn't talk to them
