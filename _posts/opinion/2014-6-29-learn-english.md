A friend who started a company in German

At the seed stage our valuation was in principe $100,000,because Julian got 10% of the company.

the money was the least important of the things Julian gave us

I apologize to anyone who had to work with me there

You could write a book about how to succeed in business by doing everything in exactly the opposite way

It's not startups that have to worry about this.

because they don't give customer what they want.

Restaurants with great food seem to prosper no matter what.

It's true that....

You hear all kinds of reasons why startups fail.But can you think of one that had a massively popular product and still failed

The real problems was that the customer didn't want the product

When I was trying to think of the things startups needed to do.

get a version 1 as soon as you can

The only way to make something customers want is to get a prototype in front of them and refine it based on their reactions.

You make elaborate plans for a product, hire a team of engineers to develop it, and then find that you've spent two million dollars to develop the Bubble, 


At first we expected our customers to be web consultants.

But it trun out they didn't like us, because our software was easy to use and we hosted the site.

It would be too easy for clients to fire them.

we'd be able to sign up a lot of catalog companies, because selling online was a natural extension of their existing business.

extension of the existing business

The middle managers we talked to at catalog companies saw the Web not as an opportunity, but as something that meant more work for them

Among them was Frederick's of Hollywood, which gave us valuable experience dealing with heavy loads on our servers

It's worth trying very, very hard to make technology easy to use.

Hackers are so used to computers that 

they have no idea how horrifying software seems to normal people.

A 10% imporvement in ease of use doesn't just increase your sales 10%.

A 10% imporvement in ease of use doesn't just increase your sales 10%

It's more likely to double your sales

figure out what customer want

No matter what kind of startup you start, it will be a stretch for you, the founders, to understand what users want.

If you want ideas for startups, one of the most valuable things you could do is find a middle-sized non-technology company
and spend a couple weeks watching what they do with computer.

Start by writing software for somaller companies, because it's easier to sell to them.

It's easier to make an inexpensive product more powerful than to make a powerful product cheaper.

To make all this happen, you're going to need money.

I think it's wise to take money from investors.

To be self-fundig, you have to start as a consulting company, and it's hard to switch from that to a product company.

The way to get rich from a startup is to maximize the company's chances of succeeding, not maximize the amount of stock you retain.

so if you can trade your stock for something that improve your odds, it's really a smart move.


To most hackers, getting investors seems like a terrifying and mysterious process.

give an outline of how it works.

The first thing you need to do is to get a few tens of thousands of dollars to pay your expenses while you develop a prototype.

This is called seed capital.

Because so little money is involved, raising seed capital is comparatively easy.

Usually you get seed money from individual rich people called angel. Often they're people who got rich from technology.

have an elaborate business plan.

Most know they're supposed to decide qucikly

he gave us a lot of advice about business, and did all the legal work of getting us set up as a company.

Some angels, especially those with technology backgrounds, may be satisfied with a demo and a verbal description of what you plan to do.

a verbal description of what you plan to do.

At this stage, all most investors expect is a brief description of what you plan to do and how you're going to make money from it, and how the resumes of the founders.

you're going to have to have some kind of company.

But if you have a number of people who are expected to contribute in varying degress, arranging the proportions of stock can be hard

I have no ideas for dealing with this problem. 

All I can say is, try hard to do it right.

One of the worst things that happend to a startup is to run into intellectual property problems.

it came closer to killing us than any competitor ever did.

Usually investors are financially equivalent to founders.

How do you decide wthat the value of the compant should be?

Julian thought we ought to value the company at serveral million dollars. I thought it was preposterous to claim that a couple thousand of code, whichh was all we had at the time, werer worth veral million dollars.

What I didn't grasp at the time was that the valuation wasn't just the value of the code we had written so far. It was also the value of our ideas, which turned out to  right, and of all future work we'd do, which truned out to be a lot.

The next round of funding is the one in whcih you might deal with venture capital firms.

You don't want to run out of money while you're trying to negotiate with them.

Getting money from an actual VC firm is a bigger deal than getting money from angels.

Usually the claim is that you need someone more mature and experienced, with a business background.

The amount of money invloved was larger, millions usually.


That might have been ok if he was conten to limit hemiself to talking to the press, but what if he wanted to have a say in running the compant

I'm happy to say 

In nearly every startup that fails, the proximate cause is running out of money.

Ideally this meant getting a lot of customers fast.

But is was easy for the meaning to slide over into hiring a lot of people fast

When they appeared it seemed search was a mature market, dominated by big players who'd spent millions to build their brands.

But as the founders of google knew, brand is worth nothing in the search business. You can come along at any point and make something better, and users will gradually seep over to you.

I'd say it's what to do in a lot of situation


I'm not trying to make a deep point about the nature of wisdom, just to figure out how we use the word.

Some wisdom has nothing to do with people.

Other things must contribute to wisdom besides experience, some may be innate: reflective disposition, for example.

Other things must contribute to wisdome besides exerience, some may be innate: reflective disposition, for example.

'Wise' and 'smart' are both ways of saying someone knows what to do 

The difference is that 'Wisdom' means someone has a high average outcome across all situation,
and 'smart' means someone does spectacularly well in a few.

if you have a graph in which x axis represent situations and y axis represent outcome, the graph of widsome would be high overall, and the graph of smart would have hih peaks.

But aside from that, I don't think we can get much specific without starting to mistaken.

So a wise person knows what to do in most situations, while a smart person knows what to do in situations where few others could.

So being good at solving those is key in achieving a high average outcome
