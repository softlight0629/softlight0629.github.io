Reality can be messier.

A typical trajectory might be to get started with a few tens of thousands from individual angels, then
raise a few hundred thousand to a few million to build the company, and then once the company is clearly succeeding,
raise one or more later rounds to accelerate growth.


It's hard like lifting a weight because it's intrinsically hard to convince people to part with large sums of money.

but much of the other kind of diffculty can be eliminated.

I hope to fix that by supplying a map through It

To founders, the behavior of investors is often opaque

partly because their motivations are obscure, partly because they deliberately mislead you

what I didn't grasp at the time was that the valutaion wasn't just the value of the code we had written so far, it was also the value of our ideas, which turned out to be 
be right, and of all the future work we'd do, which turned out to be a lot.

At YC we're always warning founders about this danger, and investors are probably more circumspect with YC startups than with 
other companies they talk to.

If you're an inexperienced founder, the only way to survive is by imposing external constraits on yourself.
you can't trust your intuition

The ultimate source of the forces acting on you are the forces acting on investors.

if you wait till a startup is obviously success, it's too late.

To get the really high returns, you have to invest in startups when it's still unclear how they'll do. But 
that in turn makes investors nervous they're about to invest in a flop

What investors would like to do, if they could, is wait.

Such a high proportion of successful startups raise money that it might seem fundraising is one of the defining qualities of a startu

Rapid growth is what makes a company a startup.

Most companies in a position to grow fast find that taking outside money helps them grow faster, and their growth potential makes it easy to attract such money.

The problem is not the time fundraising consumes but that it becomes the top idea in your mind.


an early stage startup grows mostly because founders make it grow, and if founders look away, growth usually drop sharply.

And when you do decide to raise money, you should focus whole your attention on it so you can get it done quickly and get back to work.

There are two things that take attention: convincing investors, and negotiating with them.

Investors will try to lure you to fundraising when you're not.


They'll send you emails saying they want to meet to learn more about you.

Deals don't happen that way.

Unless you're experienced enough at fundraising to have casual conversation with investors that stays casual, it's safer to tell themthat you'd be happy to later

Before you can talk to investors, you have to be introduced to them.

If you're presenting at a Demo Day, you'll be introduced to a whole bunch simultaneously.

investors prefer to wait if they can.

They seem like they're about to invest right up till them moment they say no.

You should always talk to investors in parallel rather than serially

You can't afford the time it takes to talk to inverstors serially, plus if you only talk to one investor at a time,
they don't have pressure of other investors to make them act. But you shouldn't pay your attention to every investor, 
because some are more promising prospects than others, The optimal solution is to talk to all potential investors in parallel, but give higher priority to the more promising ones.

how do you judge how well you're doing with investors, when investors habitually seem more positive than they are?
by looking at their acts rather than words

By looking at their acts rather than their words.

Never leave meeting with a investor without asking what happens next.

If investors are vague or resist answering such questions, assume the worst.

inverstors who are seriously interested in you will usually be happy to talk about what has to happen between now and wiring the money, because they're already running through that in their heads.

 If not there's a trick you can use in this situation.

 If you're experienced at negotiations.

 Inexperienced doesn't make you unattractive. 

 So you can just confess that you're inexperienced at fundraising and ask how their process works and where you are in it.
