I'd say it's what to do in a lot of situations.

I'm not trying to make a deep point about the ture nature of wisdom, just to 
figure out how we use the word.

Some widsome has nothing to do with people

Other things must contribute to wisdom besides experience, and some may be innate:
reflective disposition, for example

If we look at how people use the words 'smart' and 'wisdom', what they seem to mean is the different shapes of performance.

'Wise' and 'smart' are both ways of saying someone knows what to do.

The difference is that 'wise' means one has a high average outcome across all situation,

and 'smart' means one does spectacularly well in a few.

The difference is that 'wise' means one has a high average outcome across all situations,and 'smart' means one does spectacularly well in a few.

if you have a graph in which x axis represent situations and the y axis represnet outcome, the graph of the wise person would be hight overall, and the graph of the smart would have high peaks.

If you have a grapsh in which the x axis represent the situations, and the y axis represnet the outcome, the graph of the wise person would be overall high, and the graph pf the smart person would have high peeks.

If you have a graph in which the x axis represent the situations and the y axis represnet the outcome, the graph of the wise person would overall high, and the graph of the smart person would have high peeks.

But aside from that, I don't think we can get mmuch specific without starting to mistaken.

So a wise person knows what to do in most situations, while a smart person knows what to to in situations where few others could.

So being good at solving those is key in achieving a high average outcome
