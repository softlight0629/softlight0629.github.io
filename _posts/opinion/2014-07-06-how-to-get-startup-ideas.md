The way to get startup ideas is not to try to think of startup ideas. It's to look for problems, preferably problem you have yourself.
The very best startup ideas tend to have three things in common:
they're somethig the founders want, that they themselves can build, that few others relize are worth doing.


Why is it so important to work on a problem you have?Among other things, it ensures 
the problem really exist. It sounds obvious to say you should only work on problems that exist.

And yet by far the most common mistake startup make is to solve problems no one has.


I made it myself. In 1995 I started a company to put art galleries online.
But galleries didn't want to be online, it's not how art business works.
So why did I spend 6 months on this stupid idea?
Because I didn't pay attention to users.
I invented a model of world that didn't correspond to reality, and worked from that.
I didn't notice my model was wrong until I convinced users to pay for what I'd built.
Even then I took embarrassingly long to catch on. I was attached to my model of the world, 
and I'd spent a lot of time on the software. They had to want it.


Why do so many founders build things that no one wants?
Because they begin by tring to think of startup ideas.
it doesn't merely yield few good ideas
it yields bad ideas that sound plausible enough to fool you into working on them.

For example, a social network for pet owners.
It doesn't sound obviously mistaken. 
Millions of people have pets and they care a lot about their pets and spend a lot of money on them.
Surely many of these people would like a site where they could talk to other pet owners.
Not all of them perhaps, but if 2 or 3 percent were regular visitors, you could have Millions of users.
You could server them targeted offers, and maybe charge for premium features.

The danger of an idea like is that when you run it by you friends with pet, they don't say "I would never user  this"
They say "yeah, maybe I could see using something like that."
Even when the startup launches, it will sound plausible to a lot of people.
They don't want to use it themselves, at least not right now, but they could imagine othe people wanting it.

Sum that reaction across entire population, and you have zeor users.


when a startup launches , there have to be some users who really need what they're making.
not just people who could see themselves using it one day, but who want it urgently.
this initial group of people is small, for the simple reason that if there were 
something that large numbers of people urgently needed and that could be built with the amount of effort 
a startup put into a version one, it would probably already exist.
Which means you have compromise one dimension:
you can either build something a large number of people want a small amount, 
or something a small number og people want a large amount.
Choose the latter.
Not all ideas of that type are good startup ideas, but nearly all good startup 
ideas are of that type.

Imagines a graph whose x axis represents all the people who want what you're making and whose y axis 
represents how much they want it. If you invert the scale on the y axis, you can envision companies as holes.
Google is an immense crater:hundreds of millions of people use it, and they need it a lot.
A startup just starting out can't expect to excavate that much volume. So you have twoo choices about the shape of hole you start with. you can either dig a hole that's broad but shallow, or one that's narrow and deep, like a well

When you have an idea for a startup, ask yourself:
who wants this right now?
who wants this so much that even when it's a crappy version made by a two-person startup they've never heard of?
If you can't anwser that, the idea is probably bad.

But while demand shaped like a well is almost necessary condition for a good startup idea, it's not sufficient.
If Mark Zuckerberg had built something that could only have appealed to Harvard students, it would not have been a 
good startuo idea.
Facebook was a good idea because it started with a small market there was a fast path out of.
Colleges are similar enough that if you build a facebook that works at Harvard, it will work at any college.
So you spread rapidly through all the colleges.
Once you have all the college students, you get everyone else simply by letting them in/:


Occasionally it's obvious from the beginning when there's a path out of the initial niche.
And sometimes I can see a path that's not immediately obvious.
that's one of our specialites at YC.
But there are limits to how well this can be done,
no matter how much experience you have.
The most important thing to understand about paths out of the initial idea 
is the meta-fact that these are hard to see.

So if you can't predict whether there's a path out of an idea, how do you choose between ideas?
The truth is disappointing but interesting:
If you're the right sort of person, you have the right sort of hunches.
If you're at the leading edge of a field that's changing fast,
when you have a hunch that something is worth doing, 
you're more likely to be right

You want to know how to paint a perfect painting?
It's easy.
Make yourself perfec and then just paint naturally.


I've wondered this passage since I read it in high school.
I'm not sure how useful this advice is for painting specifically, 
but it fits this situation well. Empirically, the way to have good startup ideas 
is to become the sort of person who has them


If you look at they way successful founders have had their ideas,
it's the result of some external stimulus hitting a prepared mind.
Bill Gates and Paul Allen hear about the Altair and think "
I bet we could write a Basic interpreter for it."
Drew Houston relizes he's forgotten his USB stick and thinks "
I really need to make my files live online."
Lots of people heard about the Altair.
Lots forgot USB sticks.
The reason thos stimuli caused those founders to start companies was that 
their experiences had prepared them to notice the opportunities they represented.


The verb you want to be using with respect to startup ideas is not "think up"
but "notice".
At YC we call ideas that grow naturally out of the founder's own experiences "organic"
startup idaes.
The most successful startups almost all begin this way.

That may not have been what you have wanted to hear.
You may have expected recipes for coming up with starup ideas.
and instead I'm telling you that the key is to have a mind that is prepared in the right way.
But disappointing though it may be, this is the truth.
And it is a recipe of a sort, just one that in the worst case takes a year rather than a weekend.
