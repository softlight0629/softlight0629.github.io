Reality can be messier.

A typical trajectory might to get started with a few tens of thousands from individual angels, then raise a few hundred thousand to a few million to build the company, and then 
once the company is clearly succeeding, raise one or more later rounds to accelerate growth.

It's hard like lifting a weight because it's intrinsically hard to convice peopele to part with large sums of money

much of the other kind of difficulty can be eliminated.

I hope to fix that by supplying a map through it.

To founders, the behavior of investors is often opaque.

partly because their motivations are obscure, partly because they delibrately mislead you.

what I didn't grasp at the time was that the valuation wasn't just the value of the code we had written so far,
it was also the value of our ideas, which turned out to be right, and of the future work we'd do, which turned out to be alot.

At YC we are often warning founders about this danger, and investors are probably more circumspect with YC startups than with other companies they talk to.

If you're an inexperienced founder, the only way to survice is by imposing external constraits on yourself, you can not trust your intuition.

I am going to give a set of rules here that will get you through this process.

The ultimate source of the forces acting on you are the forces acting on investors.

if you wait till a startup is obviously success, it's too late.

To get the really high returns, you have to invest startups when it's still unclear how they'll do.But that
in turn makes investors nervous that they're about to invest in a flop.


What investors would like to do, if they could, is wait.

Rapid growth is what makes a company a startup.

Most company in a position to grow fast find that taking outside money helps them grow fast, and their growth potential makes it easy to attract such money

The problem is not the time fundraising consume but that it becomes the top idea in your mind.

an early stage starup grows mostly because founders make it growth, but if founders look away, growth usually drop sharply.

and when you do decide to raise money, you should focus whole your attention on it so you can get it done quickly and get back to work

There are two things that take attention:

investors will try to lure you to fundraising when you're not

They will send you emails saying they want to meet to learn more about you.

Deals doesn't happen that way.

Unless you're experienced enough at fundraising to have casual conversation with investors that stays casual.

Before you can talk to investors, you have to be introduced to them.

If you're presenting a Demo Day, you'll be introduced to a whole bunch simultaneously.

investors prefer to wait if they can.

They seem like they're about to invest right up till the moment they say no
